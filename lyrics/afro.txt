Dream of a land my soul is from
I hear a hand stroke on the drum
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue
Elegant boy
Beautiful girl
Dancing for joy
Delicate whirl
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue
Two young lovers dance face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway
Then slip away
To some secluded place
Dream of a land my soul is from
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue
Elegant boy
