This skyscraper's causing vertigo
The countdown begins in Tokyo
Twenty-seven days alone means twenty million ways to cope without you

I'm in a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I'd tease her
Thought I'd never be her
Quite the job you've done on me, sir
You've been hosting parties in my mind
I'm working overtime to have you in my world
Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl

Forced to get creative, wrote my feelings down
The independent lady in me's nowhere to be found
I can't wait another day to see you
How embarrassing to be this way

I'm in a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I'd tease her
Thought I'd never be her
Quite the job you've done on me, sir
You've been hosting parties in my mind
I'm working overtime to have you in my world
Oh, what a curse it is to be in love

I wait by the phone like a high school movie
Dream at the shows, you'll come runnin' to me
Think I see you in the wings, God
I'm hallucinating

What a reckless fever, love-struck girl, I'd tease her
Thought I'd never be her
Quite the job you've done on me, sir
You've been hosting parties in my mind
I'm working overtime, you've become my whole world
Oh, what a curse it is to be a lover girl
