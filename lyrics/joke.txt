I don't wanna kill you
But 1, 2, 3, i'm gonna shoot
Tell me more How much you scream?
Ah-ah 
Oh my, I feel so high from head to toe
Love you! 
 
I know you need to be someone
Evil angel
Or someone has to suffer

Baby you've got nothing 
Cuz i ain't got nothing
When you find out why we got in 
Rather be laughing 
Get down on your knees beg forgiveness
My love that's up to you

I don't wanna kill you
But I can't control my rules 멋대로
발사 자 1, 2, 3 yeah time to quit
Ah- ah 
Keep running running coming stunning
You can't move 
Love you! 

I know you need to be someone
Evil angel
Or someone has to suffer

Baby you've got nothing 
Cuz i ain't got nothing
When you find out why we got in
Rather be laughing
Get down on your knees beg forgiveness
My love that's up to you
