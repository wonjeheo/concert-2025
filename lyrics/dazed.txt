"Think easy" she said,
"Forever young and so wild 
or pull a gun and then fire it"
 
"It's easy" she said,
"You're never young 
if you don't run so get over"

We still got walls on those sides
maybe
I wanna know how to climb,
we're blind
How'd we get air all this time

these things,
I never thought when you were mine...

We used to break it together
We used to dive in our highest feelings
Are we growing older together?
I don't wanna miss anything when I'm dreaming

We used to break it together
We used to dive in our highest feelings
Are we growing older together?
I don't wanna miss anything when I'm dreaming
about when we were Dazed & Confused
