차가운 숨, 고르고 다시
다른 마음 소망이다
우리는 볕 중앙에 선
투광과도 같은 것을

선을 유영해 
검게 그을려
이건 우연일까
하는 그때까지만 

When the gun goes off my mind
Fear more and more and more
Don't forget who we are

Life is not flexible yet
Reason of our ugliness
Don't forget who we are

질투 어린 조롱들과
괴리들은 동행일까
네가 숨긴 비밀들이
되려 내겐 기회군

선을 유영해 
검게 그을려
이건 우연일까
하는 그때까지만 

When the gun goes off my mind
Fear more and more and more
Don't forget who we are

Life is not flexible yet
Reason of our ugliness
Don't forget who we are

Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?
Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?
Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?
Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?

Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?
Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?
Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know about us?
Do you wanna know?
Do you wanna know?

When the gun goes off my mind
Fear more and more and more
Don't forget who we are

Life is not flexible yet
Reason of our ugliness
Don't forget who we are

When the gun goes off my mind
Fear more and more and more
Don't forget who we are

Life is not flexible yet
Reason of our ugliness
Don't forget who we are 
We are, we are
