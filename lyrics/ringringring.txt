Steppin' out from where you're stuck in and
Steppin' out to floor where you can stand

See around no one can find exit
Satellites are always sending message
Share your writes to make fancy yourself

Ring Ring Ring
And nothing
Ring Ring Ring
And nothing

Steppin' out
Steppin' out

Ring Ring Ring
And nothing
Ring Ring Ring
And nothing

Steppin' out
Steppin' out
Steppin' out

Smash it out the castle made of sand
That's a lie, don't believe what they said

See around no one can say truths
Shut your mouth your knowledge is useless
Every time we should prove for noises
