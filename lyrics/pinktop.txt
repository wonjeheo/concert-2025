The guy in a pink top 
Walkin' like he got everything ready already 

The guy in a pink top 
Chased me down the block and followed my eyes 

And he said to me 

The guy in a pink top 
Said he likes my music, likes my perfume 

The guy in a pink top 
Said he'll let me do whatever I want 

And he said to me 

It don't matter who you are 
It don't matter what you like 
It don't matter how you behave 
It don't matter how I dress 
As long as I walk my path 
"Honey, it don't matter"

The guy in a pink top
Said he likes my fashion, likes my perfume 

The guy in a pink top
Asking us if he could dance on the floor

And I said to him 

It don't matter who you are 
It don't matter what you like 
It don't matter how you behave 
It don't matter how I dress 
It don't matter how you behave
It don't matter how you dress
As long as I walk my path 
"Honey, it don't matter”

"Honey, it don't matter”
"Honey, it don't matter”
"Honey, it don't matter”
"Honey, it don't matter”
"Honey, it don't matter”
"Honey, it don't matter”
