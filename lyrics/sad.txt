If I could breathe so easy like others do 
In this sickening place 
If I could stare at people like they do
Without offending them

I would've done anything to fix their uneven hearts with love 
I'd treat you like my family
So you could realize how fucked up you were 
You were 
You were  
The worst 

I don't get any lower now
So you just keep troubling yourself 
While I'm cleaning the shit you made 
You just take out the boring trash

No more negotiation now 
So you be ready for the end 
While I'm messing with my guy 
You could fuck off, I'll stop the boring age 

Some say I'm the different one but 
I'm sure I don't belong in 'em
I cannot stay here 
My love don't exist for your money or you  
Or you
For us
Hell no  

I don't get any lower now 
So you just keep troubling yourself
While I'm cleaning the shit you made 
You just take out the boring trash

No more negotiation now  
So you be ready for the end  
While I'm messing with my guy 
You could fuck off, I'll stop the boring age

I don't get any lower now 
So you just keep troubling yourself
While I'm cleaning the shit you made 
You just take out the boring trash

No more negotiation now  
So you be ready for the end  
While I'm messing with my guy 
You could fuck off, I'll stop the boring age
